I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! \\n\\nWe first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.\\n\\nThe looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.\\n\\nWhat I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. \\n\\nThe attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.\\n\\nFive stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here.\",\n  'date': Timestamp('2015-12-20 21:47:02')},\n {'review_id': 'XDAv3vVYTwCOhGAeeNLXsg',\n  'user_id': 'w90KNnzS6Ao3k-njRlCEeA',\n  'business_id': '2bl6G1zgXUHbMGwEocqMSg',\n  'stars': 5,\n  'useful': 1,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"Dave was very nice and explained the menu, the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious, hit the spot.

The staff at the Riviera Mansion are top notch and really created a premium experience for us, from the first email we sent to Breanna to the walk-through, the tasting, rehearsal and the wedding day itself! We felt so well taken care of throughout the night- they checked in on my husband and I and our parents throughout the night to ensure we had our favorite drink in hand, got to taste all of the appetizers by putting a special plate at our dinner table and kept our champagne topped off for all of the toasts. One of the big selling points for us was that the venue included a lot of the basics like catering, bar, dinner rentals, bride & groom suites, and different ceremony and reception sites. I was grateful to be able to get ready, take photos, have a light lunch before the wedding all onsite. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL and so dreamy.

I visited my sister in LA and she sprung on the great surprise that we were headin' to Santa Barbara for the weekend.  \\n\\nThe Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern's Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From the outside you can see the tanks of fresh Abalone, Dungeness Crab, and the infamous Spider Crab.  You must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit.  The inside is a classic, you are here for the food not the ambiance,  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating (be careful it can get windy). My sister and I sat at the bar.  The bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some.   We, however, were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staff/bartenders who were really awesome; enjoying life kinda people - they tipped it to the official 5 star review. \\n\\nWe started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine's is better!   They have a decent array of beers on tap and I chose a local brew.  For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain't scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.  My one critique is that I thought the Spider Crab was over cooked.  It by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but I know my seafood. \\n\\nOverall one of the best experiences ever.

I am from Seattle and came down to Santa Barbara for New Year\\'s Eve.  My girlfriends and I wanted to have a nice meal to bring in 2010. I thought I did my research--read reviews, got a recommendation from a local, and thought the online menu looked good.\\n\\nWhen I called to make a reservation I had a lovely conversation with the owner--another confirmation that I had made the right choice.  Well, I couldn\\'t have been more wrong.\\n\\nMy girlfriends and I got dressed up, made our way to the restaurant, and the second we walked in, I knew it was a mistake.  It was too cold to sit outside (which was beautiful), and so we went into the brightly lit indoor part of the restaurant, surveyed the scene and realized that we were the youngest people there by at least 40 years (and we are in our 30s).  The \"Latin jazz\" band was little more than forgettable background music, which did absolutely nothing to help the vibe.  There was no vibe.  The restaurant lacked energy, the wait staff were professional, but not personable, and the food was incredibly disappointing.\\n\\nWe knew we would be paying a lot (total 100.00 each) for a price fixe New Year\\'s Eve dinner--and I have no problem spending that if the food is amazing, and the experience is unforgettable. As soon as we sat down we started to be served, the wait staff, highly attentive, perhaps because all of the food was already prepared in the back, not many people were there, and they wished they didn\\'t have to work on New Year\\'s Eve.  It was too much.  We got our drinks (mediocre mojitos) and immediately were served our appetizers, which made it hard to enjoy our drinks.  We could not languish over any of our dishes, but perhaps this was better, because the food was absolutely terrible.\\n\\nI can only speak to what I ordered--it was the New Year\\'s Eve price fixe, and apparently there was a guest chef that night, but I couldn\\'t eat the majority of it.  The empanadas were OK; the soup was fine; I had a salad that had some kind of tangy dressing that I couldn\\'t bear to put in my mouth.  The main dish I ordered was fish and it was served in tin foil.  I understand if it was cooked this way, but to serve it on a plate, with sides on the outside of the tin foil, made no sense to me.  In the end, it didn\\'t even matter because the fish had absolutely no taste.\\n\\nWe ended up leaving before the clock struck 12:00--none on us wanted to start 2010 in a place that was bland, vibe-less, and forgettable.

And like most other Mexican restaurants reaching out to their American counterpart, you find your burgers, steaks and chicken tenders served alongside fried papas. \\nMunching on my chicken burrito, but more so picking at my friends steak fajitas, I recognized that there's a lot to appreciate from this hole in the wall.\\nNo. 1: the patio seating hosts a great view of the Riviera and De La Guerra Plaza; a popular hangout for Santa Barbara's homeless, but I digress.\\nNo. 2: The place is kind of a secret. With no front entrance to State Street, you'd never imagine a restaurant ever existed here. \\nNo. 3: This sit down lunch, complete with ice tea and more chips and salsa than you can handle, came to about $20. Nothing on this menu costs more than $10, except for the filet mignon, $24.\\nTony Ray's also holds karaoke night on Wednesday and Thursday nights.\\nHosting a full bar that's open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, the hole in the wall tries, and is worth giving a try.

We called 24 hours in advance and made a reservation for two for the tapan tables for the next evening at 7:30 PM. Upon arriving promptly at 7:30 we were first ignored for 5 to 10 minutes at the door before finally being escorted to our table, where we were seated with two other parties, two couples, one of which was clearly expecting a third person. After waiting for a waitress to arrive to take our order for over 20 minutes, a frowning teenager finally arrived and asked if we were all ready to order. The woman that belonged to the party of three that was still waiting for their third quickly responded that no, she was not ready to order because their third friend had not arrived and the waitress promptly put away her notepad and left the table. WHAT?! Apparently because this group of strangers was not ready to order, the rest of us had to wait to eat. After the third of their party finally arrived at approximately 8PM, half an hour after our reservation time, we were finally able to order. My friend and I chose to order both tapan and sushi, and when the waitress asked if we would like our sushi roll while we were waiting for the chef we said we would. We received no sushi in the next 25 minutes while waiting for the chef to arrive, but rather the roll arrived towards the end of our meal. Overall, the chef was very nice and the food was what I expected of any adequate tapan restaurant. After finishing our meal, we had to beg the waitress several times to finally deliver our check, at this point it was around 9:30PM, we had been at the restaurant for two hours, and were completely exhausted. When she finally delivered it, we were displeased to see that she had charged us full price for our sushi, despite the restaurant\\'s advertisement for half-off sushi during the time we were there.\\n\\nI will probably return here, but only because it is the only establishment in the entire city with tapan tables.

Spicy scallop roll again had too much mayonnaise, though it was wrapped very well, and the soft shell crab was heavily tempura battered so much that there was more batter than crab.

It is not just a tourist trap, even though you can find it at the end of the SB pier past all the other tourists traps. Love to get the rock crab deal ($25 for a 2-3lb rock crab with onion rings) \\n\\nMy favorite moment:\\n\\nI will never forget the day we tried their California King crab for the first time. It was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking/ S.U.P. (With paddle sports from the Harbor area) and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co. While on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier. After our hour on the ocean, we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular. Luckily since it was early (before 5pm dinner rush) we were seated quickly. The server recommended the cali kings, said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh. We looked over and there they were! Being dumped into the tanks. They were kicking and trying to climb out. \\n\\nPriced at $17.95 per lb, they came anywhere between 1.5 to 3 lbs. I went for a 2pounder. That first succulent bite was heaven. And I mean, damn that is one buttery heaven. Each morsel was so large, so sweet..all of my girls and I were silent, with glistening eyeballs staring at each other. \\n\\nAfter that day, I couldn't get that crab out of my mind. Any chance I could I wanted to go back before the season was over.\\n\\nBut be careful, a 3 pounder means you're eating a $75 crab. Only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad. For that price..I should've gotten both. It's okay, just add a $1 and you can both i guess. \\n\\nBesides the crab, the oysters are always good and I highly recommend the uni appetizer. \\n\\nOkay I really recommend the uni appetizer. I usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home, but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu. It's so fresh and clean, that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wiggling.\",\n  'date': Timestamp('2017-04-20 04:19:46')},\n {'review_id': 'CoticeRlQTiTNQBNSXqhXQ',\n  'user_id': 'DFM1-XHELDhh_MLzYg23qw',\n  'business_id': 'ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A',\n  'stars': 5,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': 'My favorite taco place in SB, the carne asada is the best in town, the al pastor is not as consistently good as the asada, but can be delicious on good days.\\n\\nGreat salsa bar with escabeche and they give you fresh chips with all meals.\\n\\nI would like to try more of their menu but the tacos are soo good i keep getting those instead.',\n  'date': Timestamp('2013-12-29 17:14:43')},\n {'review_id': 'ac2zDI9BpZtCKlVfNCNMaQ',\n  'user_id': 'QliFgy1YkFPS2KHy5fv4nw',\n  'business_id': 'gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg',\n  'stars': 1,\n  'useful': 6,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 2,\n  'text': 'Probably one of the WORST experiences I\\'ve had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying, the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....\\n\\nWe made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn\\'t enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn\\'t we be first to sit down? We didn\\'t care if the chef wasn\\'t ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. \\n\\nWe ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn\\'t ours and that wasn\\'t what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that\\'s what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I\\'m pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn\\'t find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, \"do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn\\'t being cooked!\" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, \"I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!\" (very politely) He then came back with \"ok well maybe if I take your plate away you\\'ll stop changing your mind\" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won\\'t, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don\\'t come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it\\'s hard to always please everyone.

My main disappointment with this place is that although all the fish and seafood was definitely fresh, the majority of it was flown in from other locales (mostly Atlantic Ocean).

The menu looked fantastic, the staff was super accommodating, and Breanna really worked with us and our wedding planner to help design the vision and \"look\" we were going for. We said we wanted everything to be outdoors...no problem. We said we wanted string lighting and chandeliers in the trees...no problem. We wanted to use all the ourdoor lawn for cocktail hour, dinner and dancing, have a live band and a dj, sweetheart table and cake table. If we dreamed it up, Breanna and the staff were all hands on deck to work to accommodate it. \\n\\nA few months before the event, we did our tasting for the menu. And the food was OUTSTANDING! Really great portions, delicious flavors and beautiful presentation. And I will say that the food was consistent from tasting to the actual wedding, and our guests RAVED about it. We even had people asking for seconds! Wedding food is never something that typically stands out, but I can say the steak and the fish options we had were absolutely delicious. And again, Breanna and the kitchen were able to accommodate when I requested that the fish needed to be wild and sustainably caught--again no problems.\\n\\nI would be remiss if I did not mention the Food & Beverage manager, Eli. Eli was such a sweetheart--making sure we thought about everything during the preparation walk through meeting and that we were happy the day of and throughout the event. You can tell he takes great pride and joy in his job and venue.\\n\\nBreanna, Eli and team were so flawless in organizing everything that we honestly had nothing to worry about--working with this venue was stress free, which made for two very happy brides.

SOOO glad we picked this place!\\n\\nSanta Barbara is known for their super fresh seafood, so we were delighted to find that there was the perfect spot, at the end of the pier.  We came at around 11:30am, which was perfect, because we beat the big lunch rush.  We were seated within 15 minutes, so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited.  You're also able to order up at the window and eat at one of the picnic tables they have set up on the pier if you don't feel like waiting. \\n\\nWe were seated outside, so we were literally eating a few yards from the edge of the pier.  It was beautiful.  \\n\\nThe four of us shared a pitcher of Hefenweizen, which paired deliciously with all of the food to come.  Light, refreshing, and the view was a big plus.  And the whole pitcher was only $18!\\n\\nWe started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the Morrow Bay Oysters and Kusshi Oysters.  The Morrow Bays were bigger than the Kusshi, so I expected a saltier, less sweet taste.  It was actually just as sweet and the smaller, Kusshi Oysters.  I was pleasantly surprised, and these were both very fresh!  \\n\\nFor my main course, I ordered the half MAINE LOBSTER, which also came with Onion Rings and a soup-- I went with the LOBSTER BISQUE.  The half Maine Lobster was super fresh and tender.  The tail was a little chewy, but better than a lot of lobsters I've had lately.  My favorite part was the super meaty claw!  It came out of the shell beautifully with ease, and melted like butter in my mouth.  I didn't even need the side of melted butter!  This dish was simple and sweet.  The Lobster Bisque was good, but nothing I'd be craving.  I hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it, but I think they just used lobster for the flavor.  Oh!  The Onion Rings here are amazing.  Light, crisp, and flakey!\\n\\nMy friends ordered the Lobster Roll and the Rock Crab Claws (the rounder shaped claws with the black tips).  The Lobster Roll looked amazing, and it wasn't super drenched in mayo either.  I noticed that my friend didn't eat the roll-- it looked pretty basic/grocery store bought.  It would be nice if they used a buttery, toasted, baguette, as I've seen in other restaurants.  The Rock Crab Claws were fresh and meaty, I must order this one next time.  \\n\\nOverall, we loved the food and ambiance here-- a perfect ending to our trip! :)\",\n  'date': Timestamp('2015-03-18 17:59:39')},\n {'review_id': 'xHQ3-JGj8iqZa6JJeDhHfg',\n  'user_id': 'Z128ihQea7BLPh2T9q9sKA',\n  'business_id': '-Fka99c-tJ-epWYNIobqyQ',\n  'stars': 4,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 1,\n  'cool': 1,\n  'text': \"I was here for the monthly pizza luncheon for my high school class.

I only had to wait 5 to 10 minutes to receive my bowl, which I think is reasonable. \\n\\nI ordered the Backyard Bowl (which only comes in the large size for some reason... why?). This acai bowl includes a base made of acai, banana, strawberries, and hemp milk. The bowl is topped with sliced banana, chopped strawberries, blueberries, goji berries, bee pollen and granola, plus a honey drizzle if you want. It's already sweet enough so the honey isn't necessary. I added peanut butter to mine for a protein kick and more flavor. I enjoyed the bowl itself, although it takes some work to get down to the actual acai base in the to-go cup. I would have liked a few more berries too. The granola itself is kind of meh... not bad but not great. For the price ($13 to $14 after tax and tip) I think the bowl should have been a little better. Again, don't get me wrong, it was good overall. If you're hungry and can put away a decent amount of food, you should be able to finish the large. Next time I would omit the goji berries because I'm not a huge fan of the flavor but wanted to give them another shot.\\n\\nEveryone working there was pleasant, but service wasn't spectacular. I don't care too much about that as long as I don't have to wait forever for my food to be ready. The place itself could have been a little cleaner... it wasn't super messy but there were strawberry butts scattered on the floor near the chopping station and the fruity smell in the air seemed a little stale. (That's just me being super picky and an OCD clean-freak... it's probably totally acceptable based on normal people standards).\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again in the future. I might try the pb&j quinoa bowl because that sounds amazing!

There is a nice big parking lot across the street that is free for the first 75 minutes.\\n\\nYou must order at a counter, which isn't bad, I suppose, but the prices reflect someone to serve you. They let you pick out your own emoji table marker so they know where to bring the food.  I thought that was kind of fun, a new way to express yourself at a breakfast joint.\\n\\nI totally missed the build your own hash, not sure how, it is front and center. I think it is trying to choose something reading off a big sign as you approach the counter. I was only looking under the board entitled breakfast. Not good under pressure maybe???  \\n\\nI ordered a very simple breakfast called The Patrol Combo; 2 eggs, bacon, garlic roasted potatoes.  They only had one type of bread, sour dough, which I thought was strange.  It wasn't even 10 am on a Thursday.\\nI read on another review they were out of bread, so common theme? \\n\\nAll in all, it was very standard.  One thing I noted is the bacon looked way too crispy, over cooked, but it really wasn't.  It was really good.  Another, is the attention to detail, like adding the chives for decoration on the eggs.  I thought that was a nice touch.\\n\\nMy daughter had the eggs Benedict which she finished before I really even saw it.  She said it was good.\\n\\nI would like to go back and try the build your own hash.  I think that is where the 5 stars lie. I would also recommend going on a weekday so you don't have to wait in a long line.\",\n  'date': Timestamp('2018-04-15 17:11:08')},\n {'review_id': '2zDuwSNvEzV7XxgnYbtWEQ',\n  'user_id': 'yJCdY-GssksSLpdXBsLafQ',\n  'business_id': 'syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA',\n  'stars': 5,\n  'useful': 1,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"One of the best dining experiences in Santa Barbara.

If you're on a pier and offer clam chowder, you better make it good!! To be fair, I was at Old Fisherman's wharf the weekend before and then I had Pike's Place Chowder up in Seattle within the last year. Did not like the thick chowder texture. It was thick in the wrong way, where it was separating into chunks after 10 mins of eating. The clam taste was not infused very well into the soup either, it was 2 independent flavors from each other. The soup was herb-y flavored, more so than clam flavored.\\n\\n-CRAB CAKES: the worst crab cake I've ever had! I usually love crab cakes, but this one BARELY tasted like crab. Probably because of all the spice they put into it. If anything it almost had a slight curry taste. For a SEAFOOD restaurant ON a pier, I was expecting nice fresh chunks of sweet crab meat!! NONE of that, the crab was really fine (almost like canned?? texture) and there was absolutely NO sweet crab here, just spice flavoring. I was better off feeding $14 to a seagull.\\n\\n-FRESH CLAMS IN BROTH: this was the saving grace of the entire meal. The clams were sooo fresh, super sweet and great texture! The broth had a little too much white wine & not enough garlic for my taste. It was also on the salty side, but the clams! OMG, the clams!!!

Decided to try it last Friday night for dinner. Read the Yelp reviews; hit or miss it seems. Menu was easy to find on the Yelp page (thank you!) and the food was exactly what we were craving. Burgers, pasta, salads. What really intrigued me and have to admit is the main reason we went, was the pic of the artichoke app on the site.  I LOVE artichokes! I really love artichokes done well and that pic won me over.\\nPlace is very large with outdoor seating on two patios and large indoor seating. This does not include the bar area attached. We sat outside on the top patio.  Greeter was friendly, sat right away. Waitress came over right away. Friendly greeting. Mentioned it was our first time and open to suggestions. She offered a couple (don't recall them) and I shared my excitement for the artichoke app and how it was the reason for us being there.  Ordered the artichoke along with the pappardelle pasta, side of black bean soup, side of mashed potatoes. My husband wasn't super hungry so the side orders were his.  Great way to try a variety of items that all sounded soooo good!\\nArtichoke app arrived and it was GREAT! Garlic, onion, tomato, yes, yes, yes. Cooked perfectly. Easy to eat the meat off the leaves, leaves pulled off easy from the heart. So happy this was as good as hoped.\\nBlack bean soup tasted ok.  Really thick which was fine but it hardened up pretty quickly and reminded us of chocolate pudding. Mashed potatoes were ok, nothing amazing but liked the skins included and not a lot of butter.  \\nPappardelle pasta was very flavorful! Garlic, onion, tomato, olives. Noodles a bit al dente (sp?) which made me very happy. Love big wide noodles. Very large portion, should have shared it but good news, took half home and ate it for lunch the next day! Love pasta that holds up to being as flavorful as the next day. We will be back & try out the bar next time. \\nWe had an iced tea and water on top of our food, total was $48sh.

The ingredients are dripping with freshness, and feels like farm to table while you wait.  If you are looking for a sandwich, the Cubano is just the ticket.  The first time I went in, I asked the cashier what she recommended because I was having a hard time deciding.  She told me that her favorite, without a doubt, was the Cubano.  So, I gave it a shot.  Now, I need my fix at least once a week.  I think there is an addictive agent in that sandwich.  It's probably in the bread - ya know, the bread that they have calling and enticing you from the top of the display case like a seductress.  Oh, did I fail to mention that once they get you in their grip, you're soon turned onto the pastries and goodies in the display case???  They have so many to choose from, and each one looks delectable.  They even have vegan and gluten free, which I was skeptical about, but very happily surprised.

The kitchen was making a lot of food for takeout orders ahead of those in the restaurant, some takeout orders even had to be corrected after being made, and in-house orders were being randomly made out of order from how they were placed, which contributed to the problem.  Our table and others nearby waited a very long time for our food to arrive.  The restaurant itself didn't seem overly crowded at the time, as there were still some free tables.  One suggestion might be to temporarily cut back on takeout orders if the kitchen is overtaxed.

The only thing I would suggest but it's not the fault of the Tavern, is at night you might want to put some bug spray on if you want to linger outside.

So much history... \\nBack in 2006, I worked for an advertising company that did promos. Based out in Burbank, the company sent me and two other guys out to Santa Barbara for an entire week to do promos for a pizza place called Pizza Mizza. (Basically we did door to door sales) Having never been to Santa Barbara, much less Pizza Mizza, I was pretty excited. My excitement rose even higher when I saw the promo deal and their menu. This was the only pizza place that delivered alcohol!!! I had heard they used to deliver movies and cigarettes too. We were going to make a killing in sales. Little did I know, I would also taste one of the best pizzas I'd ever tasted. \\nOn our first day in SB, we got right to work for Pizza Mizza, hitting up State Street, but not before stopping by Pizza Mizza to meet with the owner. We were psyched to learn that he was going to offer us a free meal EVERYDAY while we were in SB. Oh man, during that week, I tried almost everything on the menu. My personal favorites are Thai Chicken, Pancetta & Artichoke, Chicken & Spinach Florentine, and Tangy BBQ Chicken. It looks like their menu has changed a bit since 2006, and probably their ownership too. \\nIn short, I'd have to rank Pizza Mizza in my Top 3 Pizzas of all time. No lie. It's that good. A bit pricey, but gooooooood. \\nI don't know if that ad company I worked for still does promos for Pizza Mizza, but it was a sweet deal. Couple hundred dollars in free and discounted pizza for 20/30 bucks. I still remember this one guy buying 10 packets from me on my last day in SB. \\nEarlier this year, my gf and I went to SB for the day, and I told her we had to stop by Pizza Mizza. The restaurant has had a lasting effect on me.

My husband and I live in Philadelphia and we decided to get married in Santa Barbara not only because of his family but also because it's one of the most romantic and beautiful cities in the US we've ever been to. There were so many good places for weddings in SB, but we chose the Riviera Mansion (University Club) not only because of its old spanish charm and elegance, but also because of their good wedding packages. I was close to booking another venue, but my heart was telling me to look for one more place. The day I spoke to Breanna about the mansion, I was sold immediately. I booked the venue right away. She was very pleasant to talk to, and she was very patient in answering all my questions. We communicated via email and phone for almost a year before the wedding, and she was very consistent and accommodating! I sent her numerous emails about my plans and inquiries, and her turnaround response time was very quick. When we flew to SB for our initial meeting, she was very sweet and friendly, and gave us a tour of the mansion. We fell in love with the place all over again. Before visiting, I relied on the photos in the website and on Facebook, but after seeing the place in person, it was much better, and I felt so happy that I followed my gut. And until our final meeting before the wedding, Breanna went through the wedding timeline thoroughly to make sure that everything was in place, and even came on the day of the wedding to check if everything was all set. All in all, our wedding experience with the Riviera Mansion was a beautiful experience we will never forget, and we're so happy that we chose to make beautiful lifetime memories here.\",\n  'date': Timestamp('2016-08-05 21:41:02')},\n {'review_id': 'HW6-TdCnCxg2IZxjsntdEA',\n  'user_id': 'oYH-oNSoIjA98IXC6nabYA',\n  'business_id': 'vsrryxBR2Jykl71qa1H6SQ',\n  'stars': 1,\n  'useful': 2,\n  'funny': 5,\n  'cool': 1,\n  'text': \"In town for only a day we tried to find a good breakfast.

In fact, it's some of the best espresso I've ever had (better than even the best I've found in LA/SF). It has a fruited sweetness to it, a hint of red fruit, perfect mouthfeel, and insane sweetness. Their beans are from Coava, which I'd never had until coming here, and the espresso blend is just brilliant. I think they used to use coffee from Handlebar, which also makes good espresso, but I'm very glad they switched because Coava makes a much more interesting espresso (Handlebar is good, but very typical--roasty toasty notes, caramelly, but definitely not fruity).\\n\\nI like to get a Gibraltar, a Cappuccino, or just straight espresso. The Gibraltar and Cappuccino both bring out the strawberry notes of the espresso, and end up very sweet because the espresso is just great here. The texture they achieve on their milk is fantastic as well--exactly what I want in a Cappuccino. That said, if I want something with more punch I just go straight for the espresso.\\n\\nTheir toasts are also very good. I think they've changed how they do toasts since previous reviewers posted--they prepare the toast for you, so it actually is instagram ready if you're into that :)\\n\\nAs for ambiance, this place is perfect. The opened garage door makes the whole place feel very open and spacious. Strong hipster and surfer vibes around, you'll often see people barefoot. Also usually a couple people working on their laptops. There's about 4 or 5 power outlets available. Usually I've been able to get a spot with an outlet if I need it, but in the morning it can be so busy that it's hard to find a free table with an outlet.\\n\\nHighly recommend stopping in here if you like fruitier espresso drinks.\",\n  'date': Timestamp('2018-08-16 07:03:58')},\n {'review_id': 'DPNjBIk4ddCP1kxulQ853Q',\n  'user_id': 'SyYfDmdNeo645Uj-f0A0IQ',\n  'business_id': 'uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A',\n  'stars': 5,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 1,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"All I have to say is this place is a hidden gem!!!

Communication with the mansion in the months preceding was very cordial and on the day of the event the staff was very attentive and friendly. The mansion staff, furthermore, as you would expect, is well acquainted with many wedding service providers around town - DJs, florists etc., - which can help assist in the booking process for outside vendors.

Ah, and so went the leftist movement.\\n\\nAnyways, back to the review.  You drive up the highway past Santa Barbara, and wind up a beautiful hill and into the wine country.  Turn off on an easy to miss left turn, and then go right down into a heavily-wooded canyon.  \\n\\nCold Spring Tavern originated as a coach stop in the mid-1800s, and the buildings all (at least) appear to be original.  Water damaged wood structures with the clear evidence of termite infestation.  Now it's a hot spot for motorcycle riders (both the original gangsta freebird riders and also the rich dudes with a bike or the crotch rockets), old guys with really sweet cars, and also the everyday Joe who just wants some damn good barbecue.\\n\\nIf you go on a day that isn't Sunday, you will have the option of a variety of reasonably-priced sandwiches, ribs, chicken, and pork.  Sunday afternoon is really the time to go, however.  A MASSIVE Samoan guy manning a barbecue, and piling huge sandwiches full of beautifully cooked tri-tip.  The barbecue sauce has a little kick and is delicious.  Even the horseradish (of which I am not usually a fan) is a perfect compliment to this sandwich.  Get two of them, trust me, and for $6 or so a pop this is a deal that can't be beat.  Sloppy, tender meat, perfectly complimentary sauces, and fresh rolls that are other-worldly.\\n\\nAnd then sit around, gorge yourself, have a few drinks and enjoy the live music.\\n\\nThis is a place where you go to be yourself... no one is judging you, because everyone is there for one reason and one reason only... great food and a unique atmosphere.\\n\\nIf you're going for dinner, make sure to bring a full wallet, because the prices escalate quickly.  Gone are the rib and tri-tip deals.  Arriving are the interesting dishes (rabbit, duck, venison, etc.) with prices to match.  I haven't eaten dinner, but I have looked at the menu, and it looks like a very special spot... I will be going, and I will add to this review when I do.\\n\\nI can't say enough good things about this place.  It is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.  I have driven up the coast from LA (about a 1 1/2 hour trip) just for lunch.  5 stars without any hesitation.\",\n  'date': Timestamp('2009-06-10 23:36:51')},\n {'review_id': '0hhIB9R55XTqnKS3EP9m3A',\n  'user_id': 'rTB2UhWGpsLMQo5kCzX39A',\n  'business_id': '29YqJwOGEuAWqlHZxMc1OA',\n  'stars': 4,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': 'Stopped by for dinner.

My fiance and I had dinner here tonight before we went to see Jerry Seinfeld at the Arlington Theater. We got there before our 5pm reservation without realizing it was still happy hour. We began by ordering a dozen oysters and 2 oyster shooters. The oyster shooter was unbelievable. The most delicious oyster shooter I have ever had in my life. It had Parmesan cheese on top which I had never had before, atop some sort of a spicy cocktail sauce, with 2 oysters including the liquid inside. I was amazed. We ordered two more. Then we went ahead and got the calamari.. and let me say, HOLY CRAP! Again, another pleasant surprise. Drizzle it with lemon and you're good to go. We then ordered the margherita pizza with extra cheese. Perfection. I had to cut myself off there, but my fiance ordered one final thing. The plate that topped off the evening, the white truffle shrimp pasta. I had a bite, and if I wasn't so full from the food we already had I would've absolutely ordered my own. The staff was so friendly. Our server was Riley, and she went above and beyond to wait on us. It was slower because of how early it was.. but I'm sure if it was busy, she would have been just as attentive! I told one of the staff it was my fiance's birthday, so at the end of the meal they brought him over complimentary salted caramel flavored scoop of ice cream with a candle in it which was garnished with mint. A nice touch. This place is classy, fresh, casual and elegant all in one. I am so happy to only live 40 minutes away from here.. as I will definitely be coming back for the oyster shooters during happy hour, and look forward to trying one of the salads and other delicious looking menu options.\",\n  'date': Timestamp('2016-03-11 06:26:05')},\n {'review_id': 'IXuK61NCRtMQ-830rWHlSg',\n  'user_id': 'LJc2B_ZqWWdtR1lvl4_qrg',\n  'business_id': '34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg',\n  'stars': 5,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 1,\n  'text': \"You will never find acai bowl like this, I've tried many different kinds to try and fill my void of not being able to have backyard bowl and only getting one when I visit Santa Barbara and nothing compare or comes even close to theirs!

The last roll wasn\\'t my favorite and my girlfriend didn\\'t really like it, it was the blue fin specialty roll they had.\\n      This place has really good sauce-sushi combinations, and I love spicy so this was right up my alley. My girlfriend and I are going back again for our second day in a row. As for price, we got all of this for $59 so it was actually cheaper than I expected it to be.',\n  'date': Timestamp('2011-03-21 18:40:56')},\n {'review_id': 's2qxextVLhCmOiUDIZSjHQ',\n  'user_id': 'BJMAl7m7wnp3kzMJDHF8nA',\n  'business_id': 'kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ',\n  'stars': 1,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': 'Food was not fresh.

My only problem with this dish was the awkward way in which I had to eat it without a shell cracker for the rock crab and how messy the soup was served in the bread bowl. 8 napkins were not enough to keep my hands clean as I ate.

We walked to the restaurant from our hotel, which was a bonus. Taking in the atmosphere of the wharf on a chilly night certainly got us into the Santa Barbara mood. Even once we arrived, the small bar style dining and aroma of the day's catch inside the place was in line with the image one conjures up when thinking of fresh seafood.\\n\\nAfter a very brief wait, we got a seat looking directly at the kitchen, and let me tell you, the staff have this operation down to a science. They are moving people in and out of the restaurant at record speed, all without sacrificing service. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, and we never once felt rushed. In fact, this was a highlight for us. Even when selecting our beverages, he let us sample beer and made recommendations on wine. \\n\\nWe ordered all of our food at once, as we'd had a chance to peruse the menu and take a few tips from Yelp. We ordered a glutenfest including a cup of clam chowder, a half dozen oysters, some coconut shrimp and the shrimp and scallop linguine.\\n\\nThe clam chowder arrived first, and it was a bit bland. I really wanted to like it since the weather was ideal and they add bacon in every batch (!), but it was lacking something. Adding the oyster crackers helped, but I would recommend skipping this. If you are in a soup mood, maybe try the soup of the day. They had a bisque, and that might have been a better option. \\n\\nThe oysters arrived next, and that was the biggest letdown for me. I am an oyster junkie - I've been known to eat four dozen in one sitting. I'm also an oyster purist, meaning I add only a tiny bit of lemon before eating them so they maintain their sea flavor. The presentation was sloppy - just ice on a plate, which was melting and wet our eating area, a measly slice of lemon and lime, cocktail sauce and a little horseradish. The oysters themselves just weren't that good, and for the first time in my life, I left two on the plate when it went back.\\n\\nThe coconut shrimp and linguine arrived together, and they were both quite good. You know how sometimes when you get coconut shrimp, they seem to be lacking coconut? These babies were loaded with it and were large in size to boot. I think I bit into the tail on every shrimp I ate on account of the batter being so delicious. The onion ring garnish was also amazing. Maybe it's just the fact that I don't eat gluten often, but the batter on everything was outstanding.\\n\\nThe linguine was pretty good as the seafood was tender and the noodles were just past al dente. The sauce was a little too white winey for me, but my boyfriend loved it. Maybe it felt like too much because I was already drinking a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.\\n\\nAll in all, I think this was a three and a half star dining experience. Admittedly, the biggest disappointment was likely my own elevated expectations. Yelp reviews caused me to believe that the food would be spectacular, and I'd say it was just good. Seeing the aquariums of crab was also sad as they were overcrowded and all trying to escape. Maybe I've just seen Finding Nemo too many times, but I couldn't watch them. Watching the chef, however, was fun, and the shellfish coming off the grill looked delicious. It's possible that we just didn't order the right thing, so we will likely go back once more during our stay to try their specials and the lobster tacos.\",\n  'date': Timestamp('2013-12-29 16:12:02')},\n {'review_id': 'U5h1khrmRCBbP06VZeaOIQ',\n  'user_id': 'N2US_XbYelFcDj5Veb4Apg',\n  'business_id': 'jW4a3W9-UkFxpglHvo_Kqg',\n  'stars': 5,\n  'useful': 2,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"Meun Fan is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Santa Barbara!

When deciding on our venue, pretty much our only prospect was the Riviera Mansion.  Once I found out that they had the date we were hoping for, we booked it immediately without looking into any other venues.  Having never planned a wedding before, I was at first very overwhelmed with all of the details that are involved.  One of the best things about the Riviera Mansion is that they provide all tables and chairs, linens and everything else for the table, unless you want to rent your own.  They do all of the food and beverage and have a very extensive food and drink menu with any option you can imagine!  You can put together your perfect menu and package.  \\n\\nWe had our ceremony there as well, and it was so beautiful and convenient!  Our reception was flawless, and the food was absolutely amazing (our guests are still talking about the food!)  We danced all night until 11:30pm which is a much later last call time than most other venues and hotels.  \\n\\nThe very best part about the Riviera Mansion is the staff.  I cannot say enough good things about everyone that works there.  Breanna is the event coordinator and she was so thorough throughout the entire process!  She took time to meet with me several times and gave me tons of advice and was there all day long the day of the wedding making sure everything was perfect.  Eli, the food and beverage director was there the entire night and took care of everything!  He was so accommodating and made sure that we had everything we needed. Chef Harley and his team made the best food, and the servers and bartenders took care of us all night long and were so sweet to all of our guests.  They made the experience what it was and it is rare these days to find such impeccable service from start to finish, but we sure found it!\\n\\nI would HIGHLY recommend the Riviera Mansion to anyone, and I plan on telling all of my engaged friends to seriously consider having it there.  Having been to many other weddings in Santa Barbara, I really do think that this is the best wedding venue in town.  It is so much more exclusive than having it at a hotel, and much more convenient than doing it at a private estate.  We had the entire mansion to ourselves all day long which was so helpful.  The guys have their own game room with pool tables and a TV so they can hang out and the bridal suite is upstairs and is so charming.

We all agreed we like this much more than the previous pizzas we ordered and will return to Pizza Mizza to try some more of their creative pies.\\n\\nHad the boyfriend pick up two pizzas on the way home from work for the family. We had never eaten there before, someone told us it wasn't all that great and overpriced, but we decided to try it because they were donating %15 of the proceeds to C.A.L.M. \\n\\nOrdered a large Thai chicken pizza and a medium half tangy BBQ chicken, half plain cheese. The Thai chicken was the driest pizza I've ever eaten. We all agreed it was a complete waste of money. Almost zero sauce, over-cooked chicken, and very bland. The bbq chicken was better, but still a bit dry with very little BBQ flavor, I'd rather eat a Rusty's BBQ chicken any day of the week. The plain cheese was bleh, again, almost no sauce and really tasteless and dry. \\n\\nMaybe they were having an off night because it was so busy because of the promo, or were running out of product and that's why our pizzas were so dry and had very little flavor? I'm not quite sure if I would try them again, to be honest I wish I'd just given C.A.L.M the $40 dollars spent on the pizzas and gotten a $5 Digiorno from Ralphs.\\n\\nEDIT: I added an extra star after re-considering the fact that they were very busy and are doing good things for the community.

Unfortunately, that's it. \\n\\nWith all the good reviews, my expectations were high. It was a hot day and it was lunch time, we didn't mind the long wait under the sun. But the wait could have been shorter if the staff were more attentive. There were already vacant seats but it took another 5 mins before they call the next guest on the list. Not good for the business, definitely not good for waiting customers.\\n\\nCrab cakes - If i didn't know what they were, I won't be able to guess that they were crab cakes. Just a fishy patty of some sort.\\n\\nFried calamari/scallop/shirmps - They were cooked just right. Could have been perfect if they were not salty.\\n\\nRock crab special, served with soup and salad - Soup and salad were served first, expecting they were cooking the crab. After 20 mins, we follow up on the crab and it was brought to our table right away... It was big! At least the top shell.. Underneath the deceiving shell was a crab half of the top shell size. The top shell was even clean, meaning it was empty like as if it has been washed and used several times already. Also, we waited 20 mins for a steamed crab to be served COLD.. Not just room temperature but like it came out of the fridge. Thinking we may have placed the order wrong, we asked the server if it was supposed to be cold. She acted surprised and took the crab back and said she will send it back to be reheated. She came back just few minutes after she sent back the crab, im not surprised that its still not warm. What a waste of money. \\n\\nSilverwares have heavy water stains, looks very unsanitary. Forks were crooked. We asked for water refill for all 5 glasses and she only filled 2 glasses and attended to needs of the other customers. Good for them, bad for us.
